                    <p>When I was in high school, I took an engineering class that introduced me to web development. I immediately found interest in building websites.. After I graduated high school, I attended Georgia Southern University where I earned my bachelors degree in Information Technology with a specialization in Web and Mobile development.</p>

                    <p>
                        During college, I had an amazing opportunity to work as a web development intern for a company named Pioneer Design and Marketing. Through this company, I learned about Figma and how it is used design websites. I followed the design layouts and built websites for different companies. We also maintained menus for different restaurants.

                        After graduating college, I landed the role as a software test engineer at General Motors. During my time at GM, I learned how important it is to test software before releasing it to the public. Software testing taught me how to look for bugs diligently. I learned that there are many different levels and types of testing that are important such as smoke testing, regression testing, and performance testing. I learned how to use Java to automate test cases. This helped make testing for common bugs easier. I also became the lead for performance testing and used Virtual User Generator (Vugen) to test the speed and the stability of the user interface .

                        I am looking for an opportunity to continue developing my skills in the tech industry and grow as a professional.
